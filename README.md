# Planetary-Gear-Box-Group-Project
Designed as part of a team in MIE243: Mechanical Engineering Design I, we aimed to create at 12:1 speed reduction gearbox 3D printed with a maximum of 6 hours of print time. We opted for the bonus marks by making the input and output shafts colinear.

**Highlights**
- **Acheived Co-Linear Shaft Design:** Planetary gear box design enabled colinearity.
- **Wiring Friendly:** All ports and wire connections have openings, even on the lid. Allows for no hinderance to use whilst protecting fragile components.
- **To be 3D printed:** Allows for protptyping and reiteration.
